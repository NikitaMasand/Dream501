Full Binary tree: tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children

Perfect Binary tree: all interior nodes have exactly 2 children and leaves are at
same depth or level

Complete binary tree: binary tree in which every level except possibly last is completely
filled and all nodes in last level are as left as possible.
The last level h can have nodes from 1 to 2^(h-1). it can be efficiently represented using
an array

Balanced Binary Tree:

Degenerate or Pathological Binary tree: each parent node has only one associated child node.
performance wise, it will behave like a linked list.
