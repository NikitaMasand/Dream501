Island of Isolation:

Object 1 references Object 2 and Object 2 references Object 1.
Neither Object 1 nor Object 2 is referenced by any other object.
Thatâ€™s an island of isolation.
Basically, an island of isolation is a group of objects that reference each other
but they are not referenced by any active object in the application. Strictly speaking,
even a single unreferenced object is an island of isolation too.
